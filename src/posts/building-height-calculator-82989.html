  <p class="lead">The Building Height Calculator is a web-based tool designed to estimate the total height of a building based on the number of floors and the average height of each floor. This calculator is particularly useful for architects, engineers, and construction professionals who need to quickly determine the height of a building for planning and design purposes. By providing a simple and accurate way to calculate building height, this tool can help streamline the design and construction process, ensuring that buildings are safe, functional, and meet regulatory requirements.</p>

  <h2 class="mb-3">How it Works</h2>
  <p class="lead">The Building Height Calculator uses a simple formula to estimate the total height of a building: Total Height = Number of Floors x Average Floor Height. This formula is based on the assumption that each floor has a uniform height, and that the building has a flat roof. The calculator then converts the total height from feet to meters, providing a convenient and accurate way to determine the height of a building in different units of measurement.</p>
