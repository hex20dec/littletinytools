    <h2>How the Days Between Dates Calculator Works</h2>
    <p>The calculation is based on a straightforward formula that involves determining the absolute difference in time between the two dates and then converting this difference into days. The formula can be generally explained as: (End Date - Start Date) = Number of Days. This calculation does not account for the time of day, focusing solely on the date aspect, thus providing a clear and simplified view of the duration between two dates.</p>
