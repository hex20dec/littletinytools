    <h2 class="mb-3">How the Calculator Works</h2>
    <p>The calculator uses a simple formula to calculate the number of days left until the project deadline. The formula is based on the difference between the project deadline and the current date. The calculator takes into account the number of days, weeks, and time remaining until the deadline.</p>
    <p>Here's a breakdown of the calculation process:</p>
