    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>The Unique Sentence Counter employs a simple yet effective formula to identify and count unique sentences in a given text. The process involves the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sentence Segmentation: The tool divides the input text into individual sentences based on punctuation marks such as periods, exclamation points, and question marks.</li>
        <li>Sentence Normalization: Each sentence is then normalized by converting it to lowercase and trimming any leading or trailing whitespace.</li>
        <li>Unique Sentence Identification: The normalized sentences are then compared to identify unique sentences, ignoring any duplicates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The result is a list of unique sentences, along with their frequency count, providing valuable insights into the text's structure and content.</p>
    <table class="table table-striped">

                <th>Sentence</th>

            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>This is a sample sentence.</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>This sentence is also unique.</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>The previous sentence is repeated.</td>
                <td>2</td>
