      <h2 class="fs-2 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
      <p class="lead">The <strong>Days to Next Workday Calculator</strong> uses a straightforward formula to calculate the number of days until your next workday:</p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Step 1:</strong> It checks today’s date and identifies the day of the week.</li>
        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Step 2:</strong> If today is Saturday, it adds 2 days to find the next Monday. If today is Sunday, it adds 1 day to find Monday.</li>
        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Step 3:</strong> It calculates the difference between today and the next workday, giving you the exact number of days remaining.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">For example, if today is Friday, the tool will tell you that your next workday is Monday and that you have 3 days left. Simple, right?</p>
