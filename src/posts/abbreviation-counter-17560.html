    The Abbreviation Counter works by scanning your text for a predefined list of common abbreviations. These include everyday terms like "Dr.", "e.g.", "a.m.", and many more. Here's how it works in plain English:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-group mb-4">
    <li class="list-group-item">1. Paste or type your text into the box.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">2. Click "Count Abbreviations."</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">3. The tool scans your text, matches it against the list of abbreviations, and gives you a total count.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">4. It also shows you which abbreviations were found, so you know exactly what's in your text.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="fs-5">
    For example, if your text says, "Meet me at 10 a.m. on Elm St.," the tool will count "a.m." and "St." as abbreviations. It's that simple!
