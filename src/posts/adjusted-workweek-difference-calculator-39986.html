  <h2 class="text-center mb-4">How the Calculator Works</h2>
  <p>The Adjusted Workweek Difference Calculator uses a simple formula to calculate the difference in hours between a standard workweek and an adjusted workweek. The formula is as follows: Difference in Hours/Week = Adjusted Workweek Total Hours - Standard Workweek Total Hours, and Difference in Hours/Day = (Adjusted Workweek Total Hours / Adjusted Workweek Days) - (Standard Workweek Total Hours / Standard Workweek Days).</p>
