      <h2 class="h4 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Days Remaining in Year Calculator</strong> uses a straightforward formula to determine the number of days left in the current year. Here’s how it breaks down:</p>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> The tool calculates the difference between today’s date and the last day of the year (December 31st). It then converts this time difference into days, giving you an exact count of how many days are left. Simple, right? No complicated math, no guesswork—just a quick and accurate result.</p>
      <p>Here’s a quick example table to show how the days remaining change over time:</p>
      <table class="table table-bordered">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Current Date</th>
            <th>Days Remaining</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>January 1</td><td>365</td></tr>
          <tr><td>February 1</td><td>334</td></tr>
