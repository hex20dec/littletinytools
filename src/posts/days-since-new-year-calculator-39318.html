      <p class="lead">
        The <strong>Days Since New Year Calculator</strong> works by calculating the difference between today’s date and January 1st of the current year. Here’s the simple formula it follows:
      </p>
      <div class="bg-light p-4 rounded mb-4">
        <p class="mb-0">
          <strong>Days Since New Year = (Today’s Date - January 1st) ÷ (Number of Milliseconds in a Day)</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The tool automatically updates daily, so you’ll always see the most accurate count. No need to input anything—just open the page, and the magic happens!
