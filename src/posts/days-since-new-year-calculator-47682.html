  <p class="lead">The Days Since New Year Calculator uses a simple formula to calculate the number of days that have passed since the start of the year. The formula is based on the current date and time, and it takes into account the number of days in a year (365 or 366 in leap years). The calculation is as follows: Days Since New Year = (Current Date - January 1st of the Current Year) / Number of Days in a Year.</p>
