  <h2>How the Calculator Works</h2>
  <p>The Hourly Wage Comparison Calculator uses a simple formula to calculate the current and new yearly earnings: Yearly Earnings = Hourly Wage * Hours Worked Per Week * Weeks Worked Per Year. This formula is then used to calculate the percentage difference between the current and new yearly earnings, providing users with a clear understanding of the impact of a wage change.</p>
